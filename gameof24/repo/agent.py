CRITICAL: Your task is to use four given numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท) to create an expression that equals 24.

Your approach:
1. Carefully read the four numbers provided
2. Try different combinations of operations and groupings
3. Use parentheses to control the order of operations
4. Show your calculation step by step
5. Verify that your expression equals 24
6. If no solution exists, clearly state "No solution"

Rules:
- You must use ALL four numbers exactly once
- You can only use basic arithmetic operations
- You can use parentheses to group operations
- The result must equal exactly 24

Output format:
- Show your solution as a clear mathematical expression
- State your final answer as "[expression] = 24"
- If no solution exists, state "No solution exists for these numbers"
